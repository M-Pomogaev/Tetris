Title: Tetris.
This version is made by Pomogaev Maxim.

The Game is all about building and destruction
    and not only of blocks
        but of your nerves and inner Strength!

You'll have to face pain and lots of suffering
    trying to reach the highest score
        but do not fret my friend!

Blocks will be falling and your task is clear
    put them the way that they make a straight line
        and you'll be rewarded!
Turn them into a mess and you will lose!
    It's as simple as that.

So good luck and have fun on you way of greatness!
    And see you in my next lab!

The end???
